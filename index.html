            <p>I absolutely hated my last job, even though I was considered "<em>good</em>" at it, I was absolutely unhappy.
              This wasn't something out of the ordinary.  Nobody was happy there, I spent half the day pretending to work
              because production was not rewarded.</p>
            <p>I have always wanted to work with computers in a role that I felt could help create or build something.
              I've always been intimidated to approach programming but I feel that the curriculum at Epicodus is at a pace
              that isn't <em>soul-crushing</em>.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>I've been married to my wife Cathy since January 2014.  We have a two year old son named Michael Ridley.
              When I have time which is hardly ever I like to play computer games.  I grew up playing Quake 1 and 2.
              But I haven't really had the time to get better at any first person shooter since then.  I used to play DOTA
              for a very long time but stopped about 6 or 7 years ago.  I guess I could be considered a very casual
              gamer now since I just bought a Switch and beat Breath of the Wild.</p>
