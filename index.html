          <u><h3>Why programming?</h3></u>
            <p>I absolutely hated my last job, even though I was considered "<em>good</em>" at it, I was absolutely unhappy.
              This wasn't something out of the ordinary.  Nobody was happy there, I spent half the day pretending to work
              because production was not rewarded.</p>
            <p>I have always wanted to work with computers in a role that I felt could help create or build something.
              I've always been intimidated to approach programming but I feel that the curriculum at Epicodus is at a pace
              that isn't <em>soul-crushing</em>.</p>
